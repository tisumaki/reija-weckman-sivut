                        Finland, like many other small countries, is a market that requires special expertise due to the local language. If your business or organization is planning to sell a product, a service or an idea to the educated and critical Finns, you’re going to need a hand.
                        <br><br>
                        The good news is I’m here to help. Take a look at these examples of what my trained, creative and essentially Finnish brain can do for you:

                            <ul>
                                <li>I can <strong>translate, localize or transcreate</strong> your website, software or product to the sort of Finnish that fits your company’s vision and target audience. You can determine the specs yourself or include me in the planning process.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>I <strong>proofread</strong> the work of others to make sure they’ve got it right. It’s always good to have more than just one pair of human eyes to go through the same content.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Speaking of humans, I can help create your Finnish <strong>AI training data</strong>. Maybe one day your customer service bot will know Finnish better than me.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>If you have a special project ahead and need <strong>consulting</strong> on the Finnish market, its segmentation possibilities and the ways to win over said segments, I can provide all this plus the indispensable linguistic planning.</li>

                    <h2>About me</h2>
                        I was born, raised and educated in Finland and for the past four years I’ve been building my career as a <strong>language specialist with a strong orientation in tech and sales</strong>. Since 2021 I have dedicated myself full-time to offering high-quality translation and language services, and I take special pride in my excellent stats in both accuracy and speed.
                        <br><br>
                        My working languages are English and Spanish; I have a <strong>Master’s Degree in Spanish Language</strong> and a <strong>C2 level in English</strong>. During my years at the University of Turku I did minor studies of Economic Sociology, among others, and focused on language use in digital consumerism.
                        <span class="more-about"><br><br>
                        My current customer portfolio consists mainly of <strong>software, application, digital product and online sales companies</strong> that are based in Europe and North America. I’d be happy to hear more about your company and its plans for Finland.
                        <br><br>
                        Oh, and did I mention my extensive work experience in <strong>customer service and sales</strong>, for both B2C and B2B markets, both in Finland and in Spain? Well, it really is a thing. Since age 18 I’ve worked with an insane range of products and services, starting from <strong>tourism, education and retail</strong> all the way to <strong>food and telecommunications</strong>. If your company does any of the above, you’re in luck.
